# Cocktail Database

Description:
The Cocktail database incorporates a simple user friendly interface where users are 
able to search for a variety of cocktails. When the user searches for a specific cocktail
the databse will return results that match what the user is searching for. The returned results
include an image of the cocktail, instructions on how to craft that specific cocktail
as well as the list of ingredients that are required to make the cocktail. Users will also have the 
option to like the cocktail.

User Interface:

When the user hovers the mouse over the coctail image, the list of ingredients and instructions for making the cocktail 
will become visible

Roadmap/Potenial Changes & Improevments:
1) Add measurements section for each ingredient of the cocktail
2) Add a 'dislike' button so users are able to dislike a drink
3) Create a more visually appealing user interface
4) Add a comment section where users can leave feedback on each cocktail
5) Allow users to share cocktails they like with friends/ other people
